# SekiroMods
Tools &amp; Mods that I used to make game look more cool, Less Grindy 

Installation: Firstly, Copy all files from ModManager into Sekiro's folder where sekiro.exe is present & also make "mods" named folder there.
Put all files from 'Merged_mods' folder into 'mods'. Those names are case-sensitive and should not be changed .
NOTE: All the mods here works for Sekiro v1.0.5 So it might work for v1.0.6 as well But won't work for older versions like v1.0.2.

This mods is a merge of following mods : 
Sakura Arts, 100x coins sell value , Remove annoying sounds , No time for plus( which gives OP Xp boost) , QoL mod Mega Merge ( which itself is a merge of 7+ mods) , Art of Battle.
Mods like Potato mod, Black Blade Outfit and Black scabbard mod are not put here coz they're large size. Download them 
from nexus site for Amazing looking player costume as well as better performance. But environment will look s**t with Potato mod. 
Other mods that can be used just for casual plays : Boss Rush ,Elden Arts ,LMSTR .
